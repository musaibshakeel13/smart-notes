# smart-notes
Smart Notes App is a simple folder-based notes application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes a basic login page and allows users to create, view, and delete notes inside different folders. All notes are stored using browser localStorage, so data remains saved even after refresh or navigation.
